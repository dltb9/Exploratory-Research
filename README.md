## Exploratory Data Mining for Subgroup Cohort Discoveries and Prioritization
A novel subgroup discovery method which employs a deep exploratory mining process to slice and dice thousands of potential subpopulations and prioritize potential cohorts based on their explainable contrast patterns and which may provide interventionable insights. 
## Background
Finding small homogeneous subgroup cohorts in large heterogeneous populations is a critical process for hypothesis development in biomedical research. Concurrent computational approaches are still lacking in robust answers to the question “what hypotheses are likely to be novel and to produce clinically relevant results with well thought-out study designs?” 
## Goal
The goal of exploratory data mining for cohort discovery is to pprovide a robust data-driven framework to automatically tailor potential interventions for precision health.
## Data
We use the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) Simon’s Simplex Collection (SSC)(https://www.sfari.org/resource/simons-simplex-collection/). The data contains 2591 families with exactly one child diagnosed with autism (proband) while the parentsand siblings are unaffected. The data contains  demographic information, family history and several behavior assessments and diagnostic aids as phenotype data. Also, the genotype datais collected from all probands and their 7605 unaffected family members.
